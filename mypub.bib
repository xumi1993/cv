	Abstract = {The subduction of the Indian Plate beneath SE Tibet and its related volcanism in Tengchong are important geologic processes that accompany the evolution of the Tibetan Plateau. However, it is still not clear whether the subduction and volcanism are confined to the upper mantle or if they extend deep into the mantle transition zone (MTZ). Here, we imaged MTZ structures by using receiver function methods with the waveforms recorded by more than 300 temporary stations in SE Tibet. The results show significant depressions of both the 410-km and 660-km discontinuities and a thickened MTZ (260--280 km) beneath SE Tibet. The depression of the 660-km discontinuity (by 10--30 km) and the thickened MTZ correlate well with high P-wave velocity anomalies in the MTZ, indicating the presence of a subducted Indian slab within the MTZ. Significant depression of the 410-km discontinuity (by 10--20 km) beneath the Tengchong volcano indicates that the volcano originates from the MTZ and is closely related to the subducted Indian slab. Our results confirm the deep subduction of the Indian plate and the deep origin of the Tengchong volcano. However, it remains unknown whether a slab gap exists and contributes to the Tengchong volcano.},

@article{tian_tectonic_2020,
	Abstract = {The eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau is under ongoing expansion. Rise and growth of the Longmenshan are results of the interaction between the Songpan-Ganzi Terrane and the Sichuan Basin. In order to understand the block interactions in the eastern plateau margin, we studied the crustal structures using P wave receiver functions (including H-k staking, CCP stacking, and velocity inversion) with the waveforms recorded by 115 portable stations. The Moho, indicated by clear Ps phases, is generally deeper in the Songpan-Ganzi Terrane than in the Sichuan Basin, while a step is notable under the Longmenshan fault zone. We found a low velocity anomaly in the mid-lower crust below the Songpan-Ganzi Terrane and Longmenshan fault zone, which may imply the accumulated partial melting materials in the deep crust under the eastern plateau margin. Clear P-to-s converted phases are found within the crust of the Sichuan Basin. They look as apparent huge anticline structures, which may be caused by ancient crustal deformation under the stable craton.},

@article{xu_lateral_2020,
	Abstract = {The Indian plate began to subduct under the Eurasian plate in the late Mesozoic. Since the Eocene, continuous continental collision has resulted in the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau with extensive volcanic activities. Geophysical and geochemical studies have suggested that the Indian plate subducted and that volcanism originated in the deep upper mantle. However, the depth range of the subduction and volcanism and the relationship between them are still unclear. Here, to image the mantle transition zone (MTZ) structures, we deployed new seismic stations and collected as much seismic data as possible from the Tibetan Plateau. We then calculated the receiver functions and analyzed them using the common conversion point stacking method. We found that the MTZ is thickened by {\textasciitilde}20 km under the Lhasa block, where high-velocity anomalies are obvious in the MTZ. Apparent thinning of the MTZ by {\textasciitilde}20 km was revealed under the Qiangtang and Songpan-Ganze blocks, confirming a component of depleted mid-oceanic ridge basalt in the magmatic rocks. Our results suggest that the Indian Plate has at least subducted to the MTZ, which has further induced mantle upwelling and volcanism in the Tibetan Plateau.},

@article{xu_sharp_2020,
	Abstract = {The tectonic uplift of the Tibetan Plateau is a focus in the geosciences. Middle‚Äêlower crustal flow is a popular model to interpret the geodynamic mechanism on the margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The model predicts different surface and Moho topographies across the plateau boundary due to the different strengths of the surrounding blocks, that is, sharp boundaries on the eastern plateau boundary and gentle variations in the southeastern plateau boundary. Here, we employ receiver function and common conversion point stacking analysis with the seismic waveforms recorded by the dense ChinArray and other local seismic stations to accurately define the Moho topography in southeastern (SE) Tibet. We find that the Moho under the Tibetan Plateau is much deeper than that under the surrounding Yangtze Craton and Indochina block; abrupt Moho changes are found across the southeastern plateau margin, similar to that under the eastern plateau margin. We interpret these sharp Moho variations across the plateau margin to have developed when the Tibetan Plateau was extruded southeastward in the late Miocene. Subsequent gravity collapse resulted in crustal extension and gentle topographic variation, while the sharp Moho slope was preserved.},

@article{han_layered_2020,
	Abstract = {The southeastern (SE) Tibetan plateau is uplifting accompanying strong seismicity, but the relationship between the crustal structure and tectonic process in this region is still unclear. Seismic anisotropy provides important clues for the deformation mechanism. Here we applied the harmonic decomposition approach and further conducted a Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) inversion to analyze the crustal anisotropy from receiver functions using waveforms recorded by dense stations in the SE Tibetan plateau. More spatial details on the crustal anisotropy and interface are determined consequently. While the anisotropies in the upper crust are relatively weak ( 2\%), the anisotropies in the mid-lower crust are mostly stronger than 4\%. The fast polarization directions (FPDs) in the mid-lower crust show a dominant circular pattern, in good coherence with the topographic contours, indicating that the crustal deformations in the SE Tibetan plateau may be mainly controlled by the gravity potential. Because of the significant Moho steps along the plateau margin, the extruded deep crustal materials are blocked by the strong crust around so that the minerals are aligned to be sub-parallel to the plateau margins.},
